// Demo mode: a public, read-only instance that keeps running on a schedule.
//
// The point of a hosted demo is to show real history accumulating on real
// engines, which a screenshot cannot. The risk is that it is public: anyone
// can reach the Run button and spend the operator's provider keys, and
// Settings would show which providers are configured. So in demo mode every
// mutating route is refused with an explanation, the credential surface is
// hidden entirely rather than masked, and the scheduler keeps working because
// the scheduler is the whole reason the demo has data.
