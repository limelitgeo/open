// Package mentions finds, in an answer, the brands we were told to look for.
//
// It is a text search, not a model call, and that is the whole design. A
// model asked "which brands appear here" can invent one that does not, miss
// one that plainly does, and give a different answer on Tuesday. A search for
// strings we already hold cannot do any of those things, so the number it
// produces can be recomputed from the stored answer and will come out the
// same every time.
//
// What that buys and what it costs are both worth being explicit about. It
// buys reproducibility and zero per-answer cost, which is why the headline
// number in this project is one you can audit. It costs discovery: a brand
// nobody listed is invisible here. Finding unlisted brands, and reading how
// each one is framed, needs a model and is a Limelit Cloud feature.
