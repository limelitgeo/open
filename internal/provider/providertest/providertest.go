// Package providertest builds a registry that mirrors the shipped provider
// catalog, backed by stubs.
//
// It exists so the parser, the runner and the metrics can be tested against
// the real target strings a user will write, before the real providers are
// implemented and without keys or network afterwards. It is a test helper:
// nothing in cmd/ imports it, so these doubles can never be mistaken for a
// working provider in a deployment.

// Registry returns a registry holding every documented provider, each backed
// by a stub that answers with canned text.
